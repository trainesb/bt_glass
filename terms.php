7-Day Policy
Please call customer service at 888-315-2453 or email us at customerservice@marijuanapackaging.com and we will assist you.
Customers have 7 business days from the day that the order was received to report the following:
Damaged items, lost packages/items, or request a return.
If customer is at fault (eg. buyer’s remorse), order is subject to a 35% restocking fee and $15 return label fee (per label).
The customer will have 15 minutes from the time the order was placed to make any changes to the orders. Any cancellation or change requests done after 15 minutes the customer will be charged the restocking fee.
If order is rejected, customer will be responsible for $18 UPS return label fee (per label).
If customer is not at fault, all fees will be waived.
All custom orders are final sales and cannot be returned.
It is the customer’s responsibility to properly pack, ship and ensure the contents of all returned packages are sent using a traceable ground shipping method to:
Fulfillment Center Returns:
3359 E. 50th St
Vernon, CA 90058
Product(s) should be:
In good condition, in original packaging with all products, parts and accessories and the UPC Code on the exterior and Received in saleable  condition.
Shipping charges are refunded only when the product was mis-shipped or defective upon arrival.
Write the Return Authorization Number on the outside of the box and on a copy of the original packing slip which should be packed inside the box.
All returns will be inspected and must be 100% complete.
All free items included with a specific product purchase must be returned as well to receive credit.
When buy in case, but return less than case quantity, the refund price will be calculated using next higher price level.
It is the customer’s responsibility to make claims with the carrier for any proof of delivery or damage to shipment returned to Marijuana Packaging.
No returns can be made on clearance sale items; these are considered final sales.
Credit will always be issued to the same credit card to which they were charged.
We will issue a refund within 7 business days of receiving and processing your return. It should appear on your statement within two billing periods,depending on your billing cycle.
Shortage, Discrepancy or Damaged Shipments:
All of our shipments are 100% insured. It is very important to inspect your product thoroughly before accepting and signing for your carton(s). Packaging that appears in good condition does not guarantee that there is no “hidden” damage. The only way to be certain is to fully unpack and examine the contents carefully before signing. Legally, by applying your signature, you are signing a document stating that you have inspected the item and it is in good condition.
Many times, it is common practice by UPS to leave packages on your doorstep if no one is available for signature. Again, please inspect the package by fully unpacking and examining the contents. If you notice damage to the product during your inspection, please email our customer service department immediately at customerservice@marijuanapackaging.com.
Shortage, discrepancy or damage claims must be filed within 7 business days after receipt. We will issue a return merchandise authorization (RMA) number if claim is made within the time frame stated.
Defective Merchandise:
You have 7 days to report any defective merchandise or parts. If you receive a defective product upon delivery and it’s not due to shipping damages, please contact Customer Service Support at customerservice@marijuanapackaging.com. Please have available order number and the original date of purchase for verification.
